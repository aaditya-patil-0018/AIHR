            "Limited professional work experience; most roles are part-time or student-related.",
            "GPA of 3.1 is slightly below average.  While not a deal-breaker, it should be considered in relation to the overall application.",
            "Resume lacks specific quantifiable achievements.  The resume mentions numbers (1000+ patrons, 60-70 athletes) but doesn't show the impact of the candidate's actions.",

        "recommendation": "This candidate shows potential, particularly in leadership and teamwork.  However, the lack of substantial professional experience is a significant factor.  I recommend considering this candidate for entry-level positions where leadership and teamwork are highly valued.  Further inquiry into specific accomplishments and a more detailed description of their skills in a potential interview would be necessary to assess their suitability more accurately.  If pursuing a more specialized role that requires more experience, this candidate would need to bolster their resume with internship or volunteer experiences related to that field."

        "recommendation": "This candidate shows potential and a strong work ethic.  Their leadership experience and community involvement are positive attributes. However, the limited professional experience and relatively basic skillset might limit their options for some entry-level positions.  Further development of skills and gaining more professional experience would significantly strengthen their candidacy. I recommend considering them for entry-level roles that value teamwork, communication, and leadership, but advise providing opportunities for skill development and professional growth.  A mentorship program within the company could be highly beneficial."
