        "rating": 7,
        "strengths": [
            "Demonstrates consistent work experience since high school, showcasing responsibility and commitment.",
            "Possesses a diverse range of experiences including food service, babysitting, coaching, and team leadership, highlighting adaptability and transferable skills.",
            "Actively involved in extracurricular activities and leadership roles, demonstrating teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills.",

            "Successfully completed Student Manager Training Program, showcasing a proactive approach to professional development."
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
            "Limited professional experience outside of student roles and part-time jobs.  The resume lacks experience directly related to a specific career path.",
            "GPA of 3.1 is slightly below average.  While not necessarily a disqualifier, it could indicate areas for improvement.",
            "Resume lacks quantifiable achievements.  For example, the impact of the leadership roles in the volleyball team and advisory committee could be better articulated.",
            "The use of '#' instead of specific numbers in the leadership section lacks professionalism and makes it difficult to assess the true extent of the candidate's involvement.",
            "Basic Microsoft Office skills are mentioned. While sufficient for many entry-level roles, stronger proficiency could be beneficial."
        ],
        "recommendation": "This candidate shows promise and a strong work ethic.  Their diverse experiences and leadership roles highlight transferable skills suitable for various entry-level positions. However, the lack of targeted professional experience and quantifiable achievements require further clarification.  I recommend interviewing the candidate to assess their career goals, soft skills, and potential.  Providing the candidate with specific examples to quantify achievements in previous roles would significantly strengthen their application for future opportunities.  Focusing their resume on a specific career path after graduation will greatly improve their prospects."
