            "Demonstrates consistent work history, showcasing responsibility and time management skills through various roles.",

            "Highlights teamwork and communication skills through experiences in dining services, basketball coaching, and committee work.",

        "weaknesses": [
            "Limited professional work experience; most roles are part-time or student-related.",
            "GPA of 3.1 is slightly below average.  While not a deal-breaker, it should be considered in relation to the overall application.",
            "Resume lacks specific quantifiable achievements.  The resume mentions numbers (1000+ patrons, 60-70 athletes) but doesn't show the impact of the candidate's actions.",
            "The resume could benefit from more detail on the responsibilities and accomplishments in each role.  Using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) would strengthen the resume.",
            "Basic proficiency in Microsoft Office is expected, not a strong selling point."
        ],
        "recommendation": "This candidate shows potential, particularly in leadership and teamwork.  However, the lack of substantial professional experience is a significant factor.  I recommend considering this candidate for entry-level positions where leadership and teamwork are highly valued.  Further inquiry into specific accomplishments and a more detailed description of their skills in a potential interview would be necessary to assess their suitability more accurately.  If pursuing a more specialized role that requires more experience, this candidate would need to bolster their resume with internship or volunteer experiences related to that field."
